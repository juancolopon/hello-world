# hello-world
my first repository

I started my journey in IT last year, after losing my job in the tourism industry. After studying for about 4 months i was able to get my CCNA certificate, I was planning to start as a network engineer but due to my lack of experience in IT I decided to take a job at a startup company, wer i still work at the moment, as a product engineer.
